## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

### What I learned

How to use react router to create custom routes and display new pages on the screen without reloading the app.

Also I learnt a new method for implementing dark mode controls. It uses custom css properties and a switching state to change a custom attribute value, when the attribute is set to "dark", the custom css properties change to their dark mode versions.

### Continued development

I want to continue my journey with react and start using typescript for my projects in the future. This is where the industry is heading on the whole and I need to keep up!
